# -Diamond-Clarity-Prediction
💎 Diamond Clarity Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project uses machine learning to predict the clarity of diamonds based on features like carat, cut, color, depth, and more.

🔍 Overview
The goal is to help understand how different features of a diamond affect its clarity. We used real datasets, cleaned the data, explored patterns, and applied different ML models to make accurate predictions.

🧰 Tools & Technologies
Python

Pandas

scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

Matplotlib / Seaborn

📊 What I Did
Collected and cleaned data from multiple diamond datasets

Analyzed trends and visualized key features

Built ML models (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest) to predict clarity

Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, and confusion matrix
